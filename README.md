# Inventory

## Description
This program is an inventory management application designed for a fictional Nike warehouse. The program allows users to view all items in stock, search for specific items by product code, and add new lines to the inventory, e.t.c. It works in concert with a text file in which product information is stored and can read and write data from and to this file.

This Capstone Project was created during the Department for Education (DfE) sponsored Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (Nov 2022 cohort).

It demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming, user defined functions and exception blocks.

## Instructions
Download the python file (inventory.py) along with the text file (inventory.txt). Ensure you save both files to the same folder.

Run the python file and follow the instructions on the terminal to navigate the menu.

NB: The below error seems to arise when using Python 3.11.0 64 bit as interpreter in Visual Studio Code (VSC).

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tabulate'

If this error occurs, change your interpreter to Python 3.9.13 (‘base’). That fixed the issue for me. You can do this from the Command Palette which you access by clicking “View” or Ctrl+Shift+P.
